## Overview

This project presents a data-driven analysis to assist an Australian retail chain operating in the "Clothing Retailing" industry in evaluating potential expansion opportunities. Currently, the company operates only in New South Wales, but the Board of Directors is considering expansion into one of three states: Queensland, Victoria, or Western Australia.

## Objective

As a Data Scientist, Assuming that I was tasked with assessing the business environments for the industry in each of these states and presenting my findings using a Tableau storyline. The analysis includes four key visualizations that support our recommendation for expansion.

## Key Insights

1. Competitor Analysis - Box Plot

*    The business environment in Victoria is the most favorable.

*    The box plot for Victoria is compact, indicating higher certainty in expected net profit margins.

*    More companies in Victoria are performing at the higher end of the box plot, meaning even a randomly introduced company has a higher chance of success compared to other states.

*    However, when adjusting for population differences, per capita sales are only growing in New South Wales and Victoria.

*    In Queensland and Western Australia, the upward trend is largely attributed to population growth rather than an actual increase in demand or expenditure.

3. Conclusion

*    Victoria's business environment is similar to New South Wales in terms of stability and growth.

*    The clothing retailing industry in Victoria is experiencing genuine demand growth, not just population-driven growth.

*    Three key reasons support Victoria as the ideal expansion state:

I.    Strong and stable business environment with predictable net profit margins.

II.    Growing per capita sales, indicating increasing consumer demand.

III.    A favorable industry trend that is not solely reliant on population growth.

4. Forecasting Expansion Impact

*    Future revenue projections can be provided for the next 2.5 to 3 years.

*    These forecasts help in planning and ensuring readiness for the expansion.

*    A solid case is made for stakeholders to move forward with Victoria as the expansion state.

## Visualization Summary

*    Box Plot: Competitor analysis showcasing profit margin distribution.

*    Industry Growth Chart: Illustrates trends in the clothing retail sector across states.

*    Per Capita Sales Analysis: Demonstrates the impact of population-adjusted sales trends.

*    Forecasting Model: Provides revenue estimations for Victoria's future growth.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides a strong, data-backed recommendation for expanding into Victoria. The insights derived from the competitor landscape, industry trends, per capita sales, and forecasting models make a compelling case for stakeholders. By choosing Victoria, the company maximizes its chances for successful expansion and sustained growth.
